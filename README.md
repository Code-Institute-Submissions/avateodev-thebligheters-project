The Blighters - Milestone Project 

 --Description--

  This project is about a professional wrestling tag team that I am a part of and it's meant to help us promote our tag team across the internet in order to get more bookings.
  The website consists of three main pages, a Home page, a Gallery and a Contact Us page.
  It has a vintage design as the tag-team's gimmick is that of a gang from the Industrial Era in London 1886


    
 --UX--

 Through this website, users are able to get an idea of who we are as a tag team as well, they can look at pictures from our matches and as well get the opportunity to contact us if a wretling promoter wants to book us for shows.
 I designed the website so that the user ca progressively discover us as a tag team with the first page being the home page with a descriptional role, the gallery that gives people a visual idea of our type of gimmick and the contact form being the last page, should they decide to get in touch with us.

  --Features--

  The website provides a three pages structure:
   1. Home Page - Visual and descriptional purpose
   2. Gallery Page - Visual purpose to strenghten the user's perspective on the tag team
   3. Contact Page - Gives user the possibility to contact us should they choose to book us.

   --Existing Features--

  The Home page it is meant to provide a description consisting of two paragraphs of who we are and our goals within the profesisonal wrestling business.
  The second page, the Gallery page contains eight pictures from our matches, our members and our tag-team's logo.
  The third page is a contact page that is meant to give wrestling promoters a way to contact us and books us for their shows.
  At the center of the page there is a logo image with our gang that will give users an idea of who we are.
  There is also a footer with social media links so that our social media profiles can be accessed and people can look at videos or different pictures from our promo shoots.
  All three pages have been classed as "active" so each of them when clicked directs you to the page you want to access.


  --Previous versions--

  This was actually my third attemtp at building this website as I accidentally deleted my first repository on Git Hub so had to start over, however I didn't finalize my second attempt as I was going for something really complicated
   and it wasn't coming out how I wanted it to look.

   Here's a link to my previous attemtp: https://github.com/avateodev/the-blighters

   
     
  

  --Features to implement--

  The mobile version still needs work as I found styling for mobile devices quite challenging and was running out of time to submit my project.
  The social media links are not linked to our social media profiles as we don't yet have a social media presence as a tag team.
  The contact form is a dummy one and not functional so no messages can be sent from the contact form as we haven't disscused having a website for out tag team. It was just my idea for this project that I would create one.
  I want to make the gallery page more user friendly and have the pictures become larger when you click on them so it provides a better visual experience.
  I would like to add two more pages that provide a description of each member of the team and their skills and as well as a merchandise page in order to sell our t shirts and promo pictures.
  I haven't added any comments to the code to separate the sections because I forgot to do it and remembered after I had already submitted so I would like to tidy up the code in order to be more organized if any other developer was ever to work on it.

  --Technologies used--

  The website is mainly based on HTML and CSS with some Bootsrap features that I used to make the contact form.
  I also used Chrome Dev. Tools in order to help myself style the page.

  --Testing--

  The website responds well when viewed on a desktop. 
  All three pages are responsive and do what their supposed to when accesed.
  The Home page displays instantly when accesed.
  The Gallery displays the pictures in a neatly ordered grid with each picture aligned and centered properly.
  The Contact form allows  you to write your email address, first name, last name all of which are mandatory fields, and the message section provides enough space to write a detailed message of what you would like to address us.

  --Deployment--

  The website has only been deployed on Git Hub as it is not a fully finalized version.
  There is only one master branch for the code.

  --Content--

  The tag team's description is original.
  Both paragraphs are my own creation as having been a part of the tag team for a year and nothing was copied off the Internet.


  --Media--

  All the pictures in the gallery section as well as the logo picture on the main page were taken from one of my team mate's social media profile as we don't have a social media presence as a tag team.
  The background was taken from Google Images to provide a vintage design for the web page.

  --Acknowledgements--

  Love Running project was my maine inspiration for this project and it helped me come up with the structure of the website as I found it very enjoyable to learn to create and code.
  I also used Balsamiq in order to get a better understanding of the website's skeleton that I was going for.
  I know there is a lot of work to be done but I found CSS a bit challenging and it wasn't easy for me to learn to juggle with all the propreties and values.
