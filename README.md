The Blighters - Milestone Project 

  Description

  This project is about a professional wrestling tag team that I am a part of and it's meant to help us promote our tag team across the internet in order to get more bookings.
  The website consists of three main pages, a Home page, a Gallery and a Contact Us page.
  It has a vintage design as the tag-team's gimmick is that of a gang from the Industrial Era in London 1886


  Features

  The Home page it is meant to provide a description consisting of two paragraphs of who we are and our goals within the profesisonal wrestling business.
  The second page, the Gallery page contains eight pictures from our matches, our members and our tag-team's logo.
  The third page is a contact page that is meant to give wrestling promoters a way to contact us and books us for their shows.
  At the center of the page there is a logo image with our gang that will give users an idea of who we are.
  There is also a footer with social media links so that our social media profiles can be accessed and people can look at videos or different pictures from our promo shoots.


  Features to implement

  The mobile version still needs work as I found styling for mobile devices quite challenging and was running out of time to submit my project.
  The social media links are not linked to our social media profiles as we don't yet have a social media presence as a tag team.
  The contact form is a dummy one and not functional so no messages can be sent from the contact form as we haven't disscused having a website for out tag team. It was just my idea for this project that I would create one.
